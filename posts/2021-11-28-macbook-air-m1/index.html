  <p>You most likely have heard that Apple switched from Intel CPUs to their own,
ARM-based CPUs.</p>
<p>Various early reviews touted the new MacBooks, among the first devices with the
ARM-based M1 CPU, as the best computer ever. This got me curious: after years of
not using any Macs, would an M1 Mac blow my mind?</p>
<p>In this article, I share my thoughts about the MacBook Air M1, after a year of
occasional usage.</p>

  srcset="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2021-11-28-macbook-air-m1/mba_hu855bbe0a9c47ac557e5b09db74fa3b06_1092595_1200x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 2x,https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2021-11-28-macbook-air-m1/mba_hu855bbe0a9c47ac557e5b09db74fa3b06_1092595_1800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 3x"

<h2 id="energy-efficiency">Energy efficiency</h2>
<p>The M1 CPU is remarkably energy-efficient. This has two notable effects:</p>
<ol>
<li>The device does not have a fan, and <strong>stays absolutely quiet</strong>. This is
pretty magical, and I now notice my ThinkPad‚Äôs fan immediately.</li>
<li>The <strong>battery lasts many hours</strong>, even with demanding use-cases like video
conferencing.</li>
</ol>
<p>When it comes to energy efficiency, Apple sets the bar. All other laptops should
be fanless, too! And the battery life really is incredible: taking notes in
Google Docs (via WiFi) while at a conference for many hours left me with well
over 80% of battery at the end of the day!</p>
<p>I briefly lent the computer to someone and got it back with a VPN client
installed. The battery life was considerably shortened by that VPN client and
recovered once I uninstalled it. So if you‚Äôre not seeing great battery life,
maybe a single program is ruining your experience.</p>
<p>The fast wakeup feature that was heavily stressed during the initial
introduction (to some ridicule) is actually pretty nice! I now notice having to
wait for my ThinkPad to wake up.</p>
<p>Battery life during standby is great, too. Anecdotally, when leaving my ThinkPad
lying around, it never survives until I plug it in again. The MacBook survives
every single time.</p>
<h2 id="chipset-advantage">Chipset advantage?</h2>
<p>Now, given that Apple controls the entire machine, does that mean they now offer
features that other computers cannot offer yet?</p>
<p>My personal bar for this question is whether a computer can be used with my
<a href="/posts/2017-12-11-dell-up3218k/">bandwidth-hungry 8K monitor</a>, and the
disappointing news is that the MacBook Air M1 cannot drive the 8K monitor with
its 7680x4320 pixels resolution (at 60 Hz, using 2 DisplayPort links), not even
with <a href="https://www.displaylink.com/products/find?vid_dp=1&amp;usbc=1">an external USB-C
dock</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe future hardware generations add support for 8K displays, but for my
day-to-day, Apple‚Äôs complete control doesn‚Äôt improve anything.</p>
<h2 id="built-in-peripherals">Built-in peripherals</h2>
<p>The screen is great! Everything looks sharp, colors are vibrant and brightness
is good.</p>
<p>As usual, the touchpad (which Apple calls ‚Äútrackpad‚Äù) is great, much better than
any touchpad I have ever used on a PC laptop. Apple trackpads have always had
this advantage since I know them, and I don‚Äôt know why PC touchpads don‚Äôt seem
to get any better? ü§î</p>
<p>Apple brought back their <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/butterfly-keyboard-vs-scissor-keyboard/">scissor mechanism
keyboards</a>,
which is a very welcome change. I have witnessed so so many problems with the
old butterfly mechanism keyboards.</p>
<p>This first MacBook Air M1 model has no MagSafe. Apple added MagSafe in the
MacBook Pro M1 in late 2021. I hope they‚Äôll eventually expand MagSafe to all
notebooks.</p>
<h2 id="peripherals-not-enough-ports">Peripherals: not enough ports</h2>
<p>Staying in peripheral-land, let me first state that this MacBook‚Äôs <strong>2 USB-C
ports are not enough</strong>!</p>
<p>When working on the go, after plugging in power, I can plug in a wired ethernet
adapter (wireless can be spotty), but then won‚Äôt have any ports left for my
ergonomic keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p>For video conferencing, I can plug in power (to ensure I won‚Äôt run out of
battery), connect a table microphone, but won‚Äôt have any ports left for a decent
webcam. This is particularly annoying because this MacBook‚Äôs built-in webcam is
really bad, and the main reason why reviewers don‚Äôt give the MacBook a perfect
score (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEaKQ0pxQsg">example review on
YouTube</a>).</p>
<p>So, in practice, you need to carry a USB-C dock, or at least a USB hub, with
your laptop when you anticipate possibly needing any peripherals. #donglelife</p>
<h2 id="not-enough-ram-for-local-software-development">Not enough RAM for local software development</h2>
<p>Hardware-wise, the biggest pain point for software developers is the small
amount of RAM: both the MacBook Air M1 and the MacBook Pro M1 (13&quot;) can be
configured with up to 16 GB of RAM. Only the newer MacBook Pro M1 14&quot; or 16&quot;
(introduced late 2021) support more RAM.</p>
<p>To be clear, 16 GB RAM is enough to do software development in general, but it
can quickly become limiting when you deal with larger programs or data sets.</p>
<p>In my ThinkPad, I have 64 GB of RAM, which allows for a lot more VMs, large
index data structures, or just plenty of page cache. With the ThinkPad, I don‚Äôt
have to worry about RAM.</p>
<p>Of course, there are strategies around this. Maybe your projects are large
enough to warrant maintaining a remote build cluster, and you can run your test
jobs in a staging environment. The MacBook makes for a fine thin client ‚Äî
provided your internet connection is fast and stable.</p>
<h2 id="operating-system-macos">Operating System: macOS</h2>
<p>I am talking about Operating Systems at a very high level in this section. Many
use-cases will work fine, regardless of the Operating System one uses. I can
typically get by with a browser and a terminal program.</p>
<p>So, this section isn‚Äôt a nuanced or fair review or critique of macOS or anything
like that, just a collection of a few random things I found notable while
playing with this device :)</p>
<p>My favorite way to install macOS is Internet Recovery. You can install a blank
disk in your Mac and start the macOS installer via the internet! The Mac will
even remember your WiFi password. The closest thing I know in the PC world is
<a href="https://netboot.xyz/">netboot.xyz</a>, and that needs to be installed in your
local network first.</p>
<p>Similarly, Apple‚Äôs integration when using multiple devices seems pretty
good. For example, the Mac will offer to switch to your iPhone‚Äôs mobile
connection when it loses network connectivity.</p>
<p>But, just like in all other operating systems, there is plenty in macOS to
improve.</p>
<p>For example, software updates on the Mac still take 30 minutes (!) or so, which
is entirely unacceptable for such a fast device! In particular, Apple seems to
be (partially?) using immutable file system snapshots to distribute their
software, so I don‚Äôt know why <a href="https://distr1.org/">distri can install and update so much
faster</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking of Operating System shortcomings, I have observed how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_File_System">APFS (the Apple
File System)</a> can get into a
state in which it cannot be repaired, which I found pretty concerning! Automated
and frequent backups of all on-device data is definitely a must.</p>
<p>Slow software updates are annoying, and having little confidence in the file
system makes me uneasy, but what‚Äôs really a dealbreaker is that my preferred
keyboard layout does not work well on macOS: see <a href="#neo">Appendix A: NEO keyboard
layout</a>.</p>
<h2 id="linux-">Linux? üêß</h2>
<p>So given my preference for Linux, could I just use Linux instead?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while <a href="https://asahilinux.org">Asahi Linux</a> is making great
progress in bringing Linux to the M1 Macs, it seems like it‚Äôll still be many
months before I can install a Linux distribution and expect it to just work on
the M1 Mac.</p>
<p>Until then, check out the <a href="https://asahilinux.org/blog/">Asahi Linux Progress Report blog
posts</a>!</p>
<h2 id="intel-to-m1-architecture-transition">Intel to M1 architecture transition</h2>
<p>Apple developed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_(software)#Rosetta_2">Rosetta 2 dynamic binary
translator</a> which
transparently handles non-M1 programs, and so far it seems to work fine! All the
things I tried just worked, and architecture never seemed to play a role during
my usage.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The MacBook Air M1 is indeed impressive! It‚Äôs light, silent, fast and the
battery life is amazing. If these points are the most important to you in a
laptop, and you‚Äôre already in the Mac ecosystem, I imagine you‚Äôll be very happy
with this laptop.</p>
<p>But is the M1 really so mind-blowing that you should switch to it no matter
what? No. As a long-time Linux user who is primarily developing software, I
prefer my <a href="/posts/2021-06-05-laptop-review-lenovo-thinkpad-x1-extreme-gen2/">ThinkPad X1
Extreme</a> with
its plentiful peripheral connections and lots of RAM.</p>
<p>I know it‚Äôs not an entirely fair comparison: I should probably compare the
ThinkPad to the newer MacBook <strong>Pro</strong> models (not MacBook Air). But I‚Äôm not a
professional laptop reviewer, I can only speak about these 2 laptops that I
found interesting enough to personally try.</p>
<h2 id="neo">Appendix A: NEO keyboard layout</h2>
<p>The macOS implementation of the <a href="https://neo-layout.org/">NEO keyboard layout</a>
has a number of significant incompatibilities/limitations: its layer 3 does not
work correctly. Layer 3 contains many important common characters, such as <code>/</code>
(<code>Mod3 + i</code>, i.e. Caps Lock + i) or <code>?</code> (<code>Mod3 + s</code>).</p>
<p>I installed the current <code>neo.keylayout</code> file (2019-08-16) as described on the
<a href="https://neo-layout.org/Download/">NEO download page</a>.</p>
<p>In order to make <code>/</code> and <code>?</code> work in Google Docs, I had to enable the additional
Karabiner rule <em>‚ÄúPrevent all layer 3 keys from being treated as option key
shortcut‚Äù</em> (see also: <a href="https://github.com/jgosmann/neo2-layout-osx/issues/6#issuecomment-604622834">this GitHub
issue</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>I encountered the following issues, ordered by severity:</p>
<p><strong>Issue 1</strong>: I cannot use Emacs at all! I installed the emacsformacosx.com
version (also tried homebrew), but cannot enter keys such as <code>/</code> or <code>?</code>. Emacs
interprets these as <code>M-u</code> instead.</p>
<p>The Karabiner rule <em>‚ÄúPrevent all layer 3 keys from being treated as option key
shortcut‚Äù</em> that fixed this issue in Google Docs does not help for
Emacs. Removing it from Karabiner changes behavior, but Emacs still recognizes
<code>M-i</code> instead of <code>/</code>, so it‚Äôs broken with or without the rule.</p>
<p><strong>Issue 2</strong>: In the Terminal app, I cannot enable the <em>‚ÄúUse Option as Meta key‚Äù</em>
keyboard option, otherwise all layer 3 keys function as meta shortcuts (<code>M-i</code>)
instead of key symbols (<code>/</code>).</p>
<p>I commonly use the Meta key to jump around word-wise: <code>Alt+b</code> / <code>Alt+f</code> on a
PC. Since I can‚Äôt use Option + b / Option + f on a Mac, I need to use Option +
arrow keys instead, which works.</p>
<p>Since the Option key does not work as Meta key, I need to press (and release!)
the Escape key instead. This is pretty inconvenient in Emacs in a terminal.</p>
<p><strong>Issue 3</strong>: In Gmail in Chrome, the search keyboard shortcut (<code>/</code>) is not
recognized.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://git.neo-layout.org/neo/neo-layout/issues/590">reported this problem
upstream</a>, but there seems
to be no solution.</p>
<hr>
<p>I‚Äôm not sure why these programs don‚Äôt work well with NEO. I tried BBEdit for
comparison, and it had no trouble with (macOS-level) shortcuts such as
<code>command + /</code> and <code>option + command + /</code>.</p>
<p>On Linux, the NEO layout works so much better. I‚Äôm really not in the mood to
continuously fight with my operating system over keyboard input and shortcuts.</p>
