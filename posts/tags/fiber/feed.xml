    <content type="html"><![CDATA[

<p>init7 recently announced that with their <a href="https://www.init7.net/en/internet/fiber7/">FTTH fiber offering
Fiber7</a>, they will now sell and
connect you with 25 Gbit/s (Fiber7-X2) or 10 Gbit/s (Fiber7-X) fiber optics, if
you want more than 1 Gbit/s.</p>

<p>This is possible thanks to the upgrade of their network infrastructure as part
of their “lifecycle management”, meaning the old networking gear was declared as
end-of-life. The new networking gear supports not only SFP+ modules (10 Gbit/s),
but also SFP28 modules (25 Gbit/s).</p>

<p>Availability depends on the <a href="https://www.init7.net/en/infrastructure/fiber7-pops/">POP (Point Of Presence, German «Anschlusszentrale»)
you’re connected to</a>. My
POP is planned to be upgraded in September.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I wanted to already prepare my end of the connection, and ordered
the only router that <a href="https://www.init7.net/en/internet/hardware/">init7 currently lists as compatible with
Fiber7-X/X2</a>: the MikroTik
CCR2004-1G-12S+2XS.</p>

<p>The rest of this article walks through what I needed to configure (a lot,
compared to Ubiquiti or OpenWRT) in the hope that it helps other MikroTik users,
and then ends in <a href="#returned">Why I returned it</a>.</p>

<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>

<p>Connect an Ethernet cable to the management port on the MikroTik and:</p>

<ol>
<li>log into the system using <code>ssh admin@192.168.88.1</code></li>
<li>point a web browser to “Webfig” at <a href="http://192.168.88.1/">http://192.168.88.1/</a> (no login required)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="update-firmware">Update firmware</h2>

<p>Update the CCR2004 to the latest firmware version. At the time of writing, the
Long-term RouterOS track is <a href="https://mikrotik.com/download">at version 6.47.9</a>
for the CCR2004 (ARM64):</p>

<ol>
<li>Use <code>/system package print</code> to display the current version.</li>
<li>Upload <code>routeros-arm64-6.47.9.npk</code> using Webfig.</li>
<li><code>/system reboot</code> and verify that <code>/system package print</code> shows <code>6.47.9</code> now.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="set-up-auth">Set up auth</h2>

<p>Set a password to prevent others from logging into the router:</p>

<pre><code>/user set admin password=secret
</code></pre>

<p>Additionally, you can enable passwordless SSH key login, if you
want.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create an RSA key, because <a href="https://forum.mikrotik.com/viewtopic.php?t=109143">ed25519 keys are not
supported</a>:</p>

<pre><code>% ssh-keygen -t rsa
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key: /home/michael/.ssh/id_mikrotik
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>Upload the <code>id_mikrotik.pub</code> file in Webfig</p></li>

<li><p>Import the SSH public key for the <code>admin</code> user:</p>

<pre><code>/user ssh-keys import user=admin public-key-file=id_mikrotik.pub
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="lock-down-the-router">Lock down the router</h2>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/display/ROS/Webfig#Webfig-EnableHTTPS">Enable HTTPS in Webfig</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Disable all remote access except for SSH and HTTPS:</p>

<pre><code>/ip service disable telnet,ftp,www,api,api-ssl,winbox
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>Follow <a href="https://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Manual:Securing_Your_Router#Neighbor_Discovery">MikroTik Securing Your
Router</a>
recommendations:</p>

<pre><code>/tool mac-server set allowed-interface-list=none
/tool mac-server mac-winbox set allowed-interface-list=none
/tool mac-server ping set enabled=no
/tool bandwidth-server set enabled=no
/ip ssh set strong-crypto=yes
/ip neighbor discovery-settings set discover-interface-list=none
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="enable-dhcpv6-client">Enable DHCPv6 Client</h2>

<p>For some reason, you need to explicitly enable IPv6 in 2021:</p>

<pre><code>/system package enable ipv6
/system reboot
</code></pre>

<p>MikroTik says this is a precaution so that users don’t end up with default-open
firewall settings for IPv6. But then why don’t they just add some default
firewall rules?!</p>

<p>Anyway, to configure and immediately enable the DHCPv6 client, use:</p>

<pre><code>/ipv6 dhcp-client add pool-name=fiber7 pool-prefix-length=64 interface=sfp28-1 add-default-route=yes use-peer-dns=no request=address,prefix
</code></pre>

<h3 id="modify-the-ipv6-duid">Modify the IPv6 DUID</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, MikroTik does not offer any user interface to set the IPv6 DUID,
which I need to configure to obtain my static IPv6 network prefix from my
provider’s DHCPv6 server.</p>

<p>Luckily, the DUID is included in backup files, so we can edit it and restore
from backup:</p>

<ol>
<li>Run <code>/system backup save</code></li>

<li><p>Download the backup file in Webfig by navigating to Files → Backup → Download.</p></li>

<li><p>Convert the backup file to hex in textual form, edit the DUID and convert it back to binary:</p>

<pre><code>% xxd MikroTik-19700102-0111.backup MikroTik-19700102-0111.backup.hex

% emacs MikroTik-19700102-0111.backup.hex
# Search for “dhcp/duid” in the file and edit accordingly:
# got:  00030001085531dfa69e

% xxd -r MikroTik-19700102-0111.backup.hex MikroTik-19700102-0111-patched.backup
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>Upload the file in Webfig, then restore the backup:</p>

<p><code>/system backup load name=MikroTik-19700102-0111-patched.backup</code></p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="enable-ipv6-router-advertisements">Enable IPv6 Router Advertisements</h2>

<p>To make the router assign an IPv6 address from the obtained pool for itself, and
then send IPv6 Router Advertisements to the network, set:</p>

<pre><code>/ipv6 address add address=::1 from-pool=fiber7 interface=bridge1
/ipv6 nd add interface=bridge1 managed-address-configuration=yes other-configuration=yes
</code></pre>

<h2 id="enable-dhcpv4-client">Enable DHCPv4 Client</h2>

<p>To configure and immediately enable the <a href="https://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Manual:IP/DHCP_Client">DHCPv4
client</a> on the upstream
port, use:</p>

<pre><code>/ip dhcp-client add interface=sfp28-1 disabled=no
</code></pre>

<p>I also changed the MAC address to match my old router’s address, just to take
maximum precaution to avoid any Port Security related issues with my provider’s
DHCP server:</p>

<pre><code>/interface ethernet set sfp28-1 mac-address=00:0d:fa:4c:0c:31
</code></pre>

<h2 id="enable-dns-server">Enable DNS Server</h2>

<p>By default, only the MikroTik itself can send DNS queries. Enable access for
network clients:</p>

<pre><code>/ip dns set allow-remote-requests=yes
</code></pre>

<h2 id="enable-dhcpv4-server">Enable DHCPv4 Server</h2>

<p>First, let’s bundle all SFP+ ports into a single bridge interface:</p>

<pre><code>/interface bridge add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port add bridge=bridge1 interface=sfp-sfpplus1 hw=yes
/interface bridge port add bridge=bridge1 interface=sfp-sfpplus2 hw=yes
/interface bridge port add bridge=bridge1 interface=sfp-sfpplus3 hw=yes
/interface bridge port add bridge=bridge1 interface=sfp-sfpplus4 hw=yes
/interface bridge port add bridge=bridge1 interface=sfp-sfpplus5 hw=yes
/interface bridge port add bridge=bridge1 interface=sfp-sfpplus6 hw=yes
/interface bridge port add bridge=bridge1 interface=sfp-sfpplus7 hw=yes
/interface bridge port add bridge=bridge1 interface=sfp-sfpplus8 hw=yes
/interface bridge port add bridge=bridge1 interface=sfp-sfpplus9 hw=yes
/interface bridge port add bridge=bridge1 interface=sfp-sfpplus10 hw=yes
/interface bridge port add bridge=bridge1 interface=sfp-sfpplus11 hw=yes
/interface bridge port add bridge=bridge1 interface=sfp-sfpplus12 hw=yes
</code></pre>

<p>This means we’ll use the device like a big switch with routing between the
switch and the uplink port <code>sfp28-1</code>.</p>

    <div class="admonition-content"><strong>Note</strong>: I don’t know if this configuration reduces performance. I find
MikroTik’s documentation regarding hardware offloading and performance not the
clearest. Then again, the CCR2004 has no hardware offloading whatsoever (?) <a href="https://forum.mikrotik.com/viewtopic.php?t=173065">as
per a forum post</a>.</div>
  </div>
</aside>


<p>To configure the DHCPv4 Server, configure an IP address, then start the setup
wizard:</p>

<pre><code>/ip address add address=10.0.0.1/24 interface=bridge1
/ip dhcp-server setup
Select interface to run DHCP server on

dhcp server interface: bridge1
Select network for DHCP addresses

dhcp address space: 10.0.0.0/24
Select gateway for given network

gateway for dhcp network: 10.0.0.1
Select pool of ip addresses given out by DHCP server

addresses to give out: 10.0.0.2-10.0.0.240
Select DNS servers

dns servers: 10.0.0.1
Select lease time

lease time: 20m
</code></pre>

<h2 id="enable-ipv4-nat">Enable IPv4 NAT</h2>

<p>We need NAT to route all IPv4 traffic over our single public IP address:</p>

<pre><code>/ip firewall nat add action=masquerade chain=srcnat out-interface=sfp28-1 to-addresses=0.0.0.0
</code></pre>

<p>Disable NAT services for security, e.g. to mitigate against NAT slipstreaming
attacks:</p>

<pre><code>/ip firewall service-port disable ftp,tftp,irc,h323,sip,pptp,udplite,dccp,sctp
</code></pre>

<p>I can observe ≈10-20% CPU load when doing a Gigabit speed test over IPv4.</p>

<h2 id="todo-list">TODO list</h2>

<p>The following features I did not get around to configuring, but they were on my
list:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/display/ROS/First+Time+Configuration">IPv4 port forwardings</a></li>
<li>Cloudflare DynDNS update script</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Setting_static_DNS_record_for_each_DHCP_lease">DNS resolution for DHCP hostnames</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="returned">Why I returned it</h2>

<p>Initially, I thought the device’s fan spins up only at boot, and then the large
heatsink takes care of all cooling needs. Unfortunately, after an hour or so
into my experiment, I noticed that the MikroTik would spin up the fan for a
whole minute or so occasionally! Very annoying.</p>

<p>I also ran into weird DNS slow-downs, which I didn’t fully diagnose. In
Wireshark, it looked like my machine sent 2 DNS queries but received only 1 DNS
result, and then waited for a timeout.</p>

<p>I also noticed that I have a few more unexpected dependencies such as my home
automation using DHCP lease state by subscribing to an MQTT topic. Addressing
this issue and other similar little problems would have taken a bunch more time
and would have resulted in a less reliable system than I have today.</p>

<p>Since I last used MikroTik in 2014 the software seems to have barely changed. I
wish they finally implemented some table-stakes features like DNS resolution for
DHCP hostnames.</p>

<p>Given all the above, I no longer felt like getting enough value for the money
from the MikroTik, and found it easier to just switch back to <a href="https://router7.org/">my own
router7</a> and return the MikroTik.</p>

<p>I will probably stick with the router7 software, but exchange the PC Engines APU
with the smallest PC that has enough PCI-E bandwidth for a multi-port SFP28
network card.</p>

<p>After <a href="/posts/2020-08-09-fiber-link-home-network/">adding a fiber link to my home
network</a>, I am upgrading that link
from 1 Gbit/s to 10 Gbit/s.</p>

<p>As a reminder, conceptually the fiber link is built using two media converters
from/to ethernet:</p>

<p>Schematically, this is what’s connected to both ends:</p>





<a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2021-05-16-home-network-fiber-10-gbits-upgrade/2021-05-15-bottleneck-1g.svg"><img

  alt="1 Gbit/s bottleneck" title="1 Gbit/s bottleneck"
  style="border: 1px solid #000; margin-right: 1rem"
  
  loading="lazy"></a>



<p>All links are 1 Gbit/s, so it’s easy to see that, for example, transfers between
chuchi↔router7 and storage2↔midna cannot both use 1 Gbit/s at the same time.</p>

<p>This upgrade serves 2 purposes:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Raise the floor to 1 Gbit/s end-to-end</strong>: Ensure that serving large files
(e.g. distri Linux images and packages) does no longer impact, and is no
longer impacted by, other bandwidth flows that also use this transfer link in
my home network, e.g. daily backups.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Raise the ceiling to 10 Gbit/s</strong>: Make it possible to selectively upgrade
Linux PCs on either end of the link to 10 Gbit/s peak bandwidth.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Note that the internet uplink remains untouched at 1 Gbit/s — only transfers
within the home network can happen at 10 Gbit/s.</p>

<p>This device <a href="https://www.digitec.ch/de/s1/product/mikrotik-crs305-1g-4sin-5ports-switch-9876046">costs 149 CHF on digitec</a> and comes with 5 ports:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 × RJ45 Ethernet port for management, can be used as a regular 1 Gbit/s port.</li>
<li>4 × SFP+ ports</li>
</ul>

<p>Each SFP+ port can be used with either an RJ-45 Ethernet or a fiber SFP+ module,
but beware! As <a href="https://twitter.com/Nexus2kSwiss/status/1394395280120897544">Nexus2kSwiss points out on
twitter</a>, the
Mikrotik supports <strong>at most 2 RJ-45 SFPs at a time</strong>!</p>

<p>To make use of the 10 Gbit/s link between the switches, all devices that should
get their guaranteed 1 Gbit/s end-to-end connection need to be connected
directly to a Mikrotik switch.</p>

<p>I’m connecting the PCs to the switch using Direct Attach Cables (DAC) where
possible. The advantage of DAC cables over RJ45 SFP+ modules is their lower
power usage and heat.</p>

<p>The resulting list of SFP modules used in the two Mikrotik switches looks like
so:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In the web interface menu, navigate to <em>System → Routerboard →

<em>SwOS</em>.</p></li>

<li><p>In the web interface menu, navigate to <em>System → Reboot</em>.</p></li>

<li><p>After the device rebooted, change the hostname which was reset to <code>MikroTik</code>.</p></li>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This was a pleasantly simple upgrade: plug in a bunch of new hardware and batch
transfers become faster.</p>

<p>The Mikrotik switch provides great value for money, and the Mellanox ConnectX-3
cards work well, provided you can find them.</p>

<h2 id="appendix-a-switching-from-rj45-sfp-modules-to-direct-attach-cables">Appendix A: Switching from RJ45 SFP+ modules to Direct Attach Cables</h2>

<p>Originally, I connected all PCs to the MikroTik switches with RJ45 SFP+ modules
for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>I bought <a href="https://www.digitec.ch/de/s1/product/intel-x550-t2-pci-express-30-netzwerkadapter-5926807">Intel
X550-T2</a>
PCIe 10 Gbit/s network cards that RJ45 as my first choice.</li>
<li>The SFP+ modules are backwards-compatible and can be used with 1 Gbit/s RJ45
devices, too, which makes for a nice incremental upgrade path.</li>
</ol>

<p>However, I later was made aware that the RJ45 SFP+ modules use significantly
more power and run significantly hotter than Direct Attach Cables (DAC).</p>

<p>I measured it: each RJ45 SFP+ module was causing my BiDi SFP+ module to run 5℃
hotter!</p>

<p>Around 06/02 I replaced one RJ45 SFP+ module with a Direct Attach Cable.</p>

<p>Around 06/06 I replaced the remaining RJ45 SFP+ module with another Direct
Attach Cable.</p>

<p>As you can see, this caused a 10℃ drop in temperature of the BiDi SFP+ module.</p>

<p>The MikroTik is still uncomfortably hot, making it hard to work with when it’s
powered on.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>Despite using a FTTH internet connection since 2014, aside from the one fiber
uplink, I had always used network gear with 1 Gbit/s links over regular old rj45
cat5(e) cables.</p>

<hr />

<p>I liked the simplicity and uniformity of that setup, but decided it’s time to
add at least one fiber connection, to <strong>get rid of a temporary ethernet cable</strong>
that connected my kitchen with the rest of my network that is largely in the
living room and office.</p>

<p>The temporary ethernet cable was an experiment to verify that running a server
or two in my kitchen actually works (it does!). I used a <a href="https://www.digitec.ch/de/s1/product/hama-cat-6-flach-we-1000cm-netzwerkkabel-7465292">flat ethernet
cable</a>,
which is great for test setups like that, as you can often tape it onto the
walls and still close the doors.</p>

<p>So, we will replace one ethernet cable with one fiber cable and converters at
each end:</p>

<p>Why is it good to switch from copper ethernet cables to fiber in this case?
Fiber cables are <strong>smaller and hence easier to fit</strong> into existing cable
ducts. While regular ethernet cable is way too thick to fit into any of the
existing ducts in my flat, I was hoping that fiber might fit!</p>

<p>When I actually received the cables, I was surprised <strong>how much thinner</strong> fiber
cables actually can be: there are 0.9mm cables, which are so thin, they can be
hidden in plain sight! I had only ever seen 2mm fiber cables before, and the
0.9mm cables are incredibly light, flexible and thin! Even pasta is typically
thicker:</p>

<hr />

<p>The cable shown above comes from <a href="https://www.FS.COM/company/about_us.html">the fiber store
FS.COM</a>, which different people have
praised on multiple occasions, so naturally I was curious to give them a shot
myself.</p>

<p>Also, for the longest time, it was my understanding that fiber connectors can
only be put onto fiber cables using expensive (≫2000 CHF) machines. A while ago
I heard about <strong>field assembly connectors</strong> so I wanted to verify that those
indeed work.</p>

<hr />

<p>Aside from practical reasons, playing around with fiber networking also makes
for a good hobby during a pandemic :)</p>

<h2 id="hardware-selection">Hardware Selection</h2>

<p>I ordered all my fiber equipment at <a href="https://www.FS.COM">FS.COM</a>: everything
they have is very affordable, and products in stock at their German warehouse
arrive in Switzerland (and presumably other European countries) within the same
week.</p>

<p>If you are in the luxurious position to have enough physical space and agility
to pull through an entire fiber cable, <strong>without having to remove any
connectors</strong>, you can make a new network connection with just a few parts:</p>

<p>I recommend buying an extra fiber cable or two so that you can accidentally
damage a cable and still have enough spares.</p>

<p>Total cost thus far: just under 100 CHF. If you have existing switches with a
free SFP slot, you can use those instead of the media converters and save most
of the cost.</p>

<hr />

<p>If you need to <strong>temporarily remove</strong> one or both of the fiber cable connector(s),
you also need field assembly connectors and a few tools in addition:</p>

<p>I recommend buying twice the number of field assembly connectors, for practicing.</p>

<p>Personally, I screwed up two connectors before figuring out <a href="#field-assembly-connectors">how the process
goes</a>.</p>

<p>Total cost: about 160 CHF for the field assembly equipment, so 260 CHF in total.</p>

<hr />

<p>To boost your confidence in the resulting fiber, the following items are nice to
have, but you can get by without, if you’re on a budget.</p>

<p>With the visual fault locator, you can shine a light through your fiber. You can
verify correct connector assembly by looking at how the light comes out of the
connector.</p>

<p>The fiber cleaning swabs are good to have in general, but for the field assembly
connector, you need to use alcohol-soaked wipes anyway (which FS.COM does not
stock).</p>

<p>The total cost for everything is just under 300 CHF.</p>

<h3 id="hardware-selection-process">Hardware Selection Process</h3>

<p>The large selection at FS.COM can be overwhelming to navigate at first. My
selection process went something like this:</p>

<p>My first constraint is using bi-directional (BiDi) fiber optics modules so that
I only need to lay a single fiber cable, as opposed to two fiber cables.</p>

<p>The second constraint is to use field assembly connectors.</p>

<p>If possible, I wanted to use <a href="https://community.FS.COM/blog/why-not-use-bend-insensitive-fiber-optic-cable-to-reduce-bend-radius.html">bend-insensitive
fiber</a>
so that I wouldn’t need to pay so much attention to the bend radius and have
more flexibility in where and how I can lay fiber.</p>

<p>With these constraints, there aren’t too many products left to combine. An
obvious and good choice are 0.9mm fiber cable using LC/UPC connectors.</p>

<h3 id="fs-com-details">FS.COM details</h3>

<p>As of 2020-08-05, FS.COM states they have 5 warehouses in 4 locations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Delaware (US)</li>
<li>Munich (Germany)</li>
<li>Melbourne (Australia)</li>
<li>Shenzhen (China)</li>
</ul>

<p>They recently built another, bigger (7 km²) warehouse in Shenzhen, and now
produce inventory for the whole year.</p>

<p>By 2019, FS.COM had over 300,000 registered corporate customers, reaching nearly
200 million USD yearly sales.</p>

<h2 id="delivery-times">Delivery times</h2>

<p>As mentioned before, delivery times are quick when the products are in stock at
FS.COM’s German warehouse.</p>

<p>In my case, I put in my order on 2020-Jun-26.</p>

<p>The items that shipped from the German warehouse arrived on 2020-Jul-01.</p>

<p>Some items had to be manufactured and/or shipped from Asia. Those items arrived
after 3 more weeks, on 2020-Jul-24.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, FS.COM doesn’t stock any 0.9mm fiber cables in their German
warehouse right now, so be prepared for a few weeks of waiting time.</p>

<h2 id="laying-the-fiber">Laying The Fiber</h2>

<p>Use a cable puller to pull the fiber through existing cable ducts where
possible.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In general, buy the thinnest one you can find. I have <a href="https://www.distrelec.ch/en/cable-pull-strap-10m-tools-495005/p/18092626">this 4mm diameter cable
puller</a>,
but a 3mm or even 2mm one would work in more situations.</p></li>

<li><p>I found it worthwhile to buy a brand one. It is distinctly better to handle
(less stiff, i.e. more flexible) than the cheap one I got, and thinner, too,
which is always good.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In my experience, it generally did not work well to <strong>push</strong> the fiber into an
existing duct or alongside an existing cable. I really needed a cable
<strong>puller</strong>.</p>

<p>If you’re lucky and have enough space in your duct(s), you can leave the
existing connectors on the fiber. I have successfully just used a piece of tape
to fix the fiber connector on the cable puller, pushing down the nose
temporarily:</p>

<p>Where there are no existing ducts, you may need to lay the fiber on top of the
wall. Obviously, this is tricky as soon as you need to make a connection going
through a wall: whereas copper ethernet cables can be bent and squeezed into
door frames, you quickly risk breaking fiber cables.</p>

<p>Luckily, the fiber is very light, so it’s very easy to fix to the wall with a
piece of tape:</p>

<p>You can see the upstream internet fiber in the top right corner, which is rather
thick in comparison to my 0.9mm yellow fiber that’s barely visible in the middle
of the picture.</p>

<p>Note how the fiber entirely disappears behind the existing duct atop the
door!</p>

<p>Above, you can see the flat ethernet cable I have been using as a temporary
experiment.</p>

<hr />

<p>Where there is an existing cable that you can temporarily remove, it might be
possible to remove it, put the fiber in, and put the old cable back in,
too. This is possible because the 0.9mm fiber cable is so thin!</p>

<p>I’m using this technique to cross another wall where the existing cable duct is
too full, but there is a cable that can be removed and put back after pulling
the fiber through:</p>

<p>Note how the fiber is thin enough to fit between the socket and duct!</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Note:</strong> despite measuring how long a fiber cable I would need, my cable turned
out too short! While the cable was just as long as I had measured, with
distances exceeding 10m, it is a good idea to <strong>add a few meters spare</strong> on each
side of the connection.</p>

<p><strong>Beware:</strong> the little paper booklet that comes with the field assembly

<li>0.9mm fiber cable (LC/UPC field assembly connector)</li>
</ul>

<p>The 0.9mm fiber cables come with smaller connectors than the 2.0mm fiber cables,
and that alone might be a reason to prefer them in some situations.</p>

<p>The field assembly connectors are pretty bulky in comparison, but since you can
attach them yourself after pulling only the cable through the walls and/or
ducts, you usually don’t care too much about their size.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Modern fiber cables available at FS.COM are:</p>

<ul>
<li>thinner than I expected</li>
<li>more robust than I expected</li>
<li>cheaper than I expected</li>
<li>survive tighter bend radiuses than I expected</li>

<p>Replacing this particular connection with a fiber connection was a smooth
process overall, and I would recommend it in other situations as well.</p>

<hr />

<p>I would claim that it is <strong>totally feasible</strong> for anyone with an hour of
patience to learn how to put a field assembly connector onto a fiber cable.</p>

<p>If labor cost is expensive in your country or you just like doing things
yourself, I can definitely recommend this approach. In case you mess the
connector up and don’t want to fix it yourself, you can always call an
electrician!</p>

<p>Stay tuned for the next part, where I upgrade the 1G link to a 10G link!</p>

    <id>https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2014-09-05-fiber7_performance/</id>
    <published>2014-09-05T12:00:00+00:00</published>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
Ever since I moved to Zürich, I wanted to get a fiber internet connection. I’ve
lived with a 6 Mbps DSL line at my parent’s place for about 10 years, so I was
looking forward to a lot more Megabits and a lot less latency. For reasons that
I won’t go into in this article, it took me about a year to get a fiber
connection, and in the end I had to go with Swisscom (instead of <a
href="http://www.init7.ch/">init7</a> on top of EWZ).
</p>

<p>
But then <a href="http://www.fiber7.ch/">fiber7</a> launched. They provide a 1
Gbps symmetrical connection (Swisscom provided a 1 Gbps/100 Mbps down/up
connection) for a lot less money than Swisscom, and with native, static IPv6.
</p>

<p>
A couple of people are interested in how fiber7 performs, and after being
connected for about 2 months, I think I can answer this question by now :-).
</p>

<h2>Latency</h2>

<p>
I started running smokeping to see how my internet connection performs back
when I was with Swisscom, because they had some routing issues to certain
networks. This would manifest itself with getting 50 KB/s transfer rates,
which is unacceptable for image boards or any other demanding application.
</p>

<p>
So, here is the smokeping output for google.ch during the time period that
covers both my Swisscom line, the temporary cablecom connection and finally
fiber7:
</p>

<p><img src="/Bilder/fiber_ping_google_ch_annotated.png" width="800" height="424"
 alt="smokeping latency to google.ch (annotated)"></p>

<p>
What you can see is that with Swisscom, I had a 6 ms ping time to google.ch.
Interestingly, once I used the MikroTik RB2011 instead of the Swisscom-provided
internet box, the latency improved to 5&nbsp;ms.
</p>

<p>
Afterwards, latency changed twice. For the first change, I’m not sure what
happened. It could be that Swisscom turned up a new, less loaded port to peer
with Google. Or perhaps they configured their systems in a different way, or
exchanged some hardware. The second change is relatively obvious: Swisscom
enabled GGC, the <a href="https://peering.google.com/about/ggc.html">Google
Global Cache</a>. GGC is a caching server provided by Google that is placed
within the ISP’s own network, typically providing much better latencies (due to
being placed very close to the customer) and reducing the traffic between the
ISP and Google. I’m confident that Swisscom uses that because of the reverse
pointer record of the IP address to which google.ch resolves to. So with that,
latency is between 1&nbsp;ms and 3&nbsp;ms.
</p>

<p>
Because switching to Fiber7 involves recabling the physical fiber connection in
the POP, there is a 2-day downtime involved. During that time I used <a
href="http://www.upc-cablecom.ch/en/get-cable/cable-information/basic-digital-offer/">UPC
cablecom’s free offering</a>, which is a 2&nbsp;Mbps cable connection that you can
use for free (as long as you pay for the cable connection itself, and after
paying 50 CHF for the modem itself).
</p>

<p>
As you can see on the graph, the cable connection has a surprisingly good
latency of around 8&nbsp;ms to google.ch — until you start using it. Then it’s
clear that 2 Mbps is not enough and the latency shoots through the roof.
</p>

<p>
The pleasant surprise is that fiber7’s ping time to google.ch is about
0.6&nbsp;ms (!). They achieve such low latency <a
href="https://twitter.com/fiber7_ch/status/508344516622159872">with a dedicated
10 gig interconnect to Google at the Interxion in Glattbrugg</a>.
</p>

<h2>Longer-term performance</h2>

<p><img src="/Bilder/fiber_ping_google_ch_week.png" width="697" height="315"
 alt="smokeping latency measurements to google.ch over more than a week"></p>

<p>
Let me say that I’m very happy with the performance of my internet connection.
Some of the measurements where packet loss is registered may be outside of
fiber7’s control, or even caused by me, when recabling my equipment for
example. Overall, the latency is fine and consistent, much more so than with
Swisscom. I have never experienced an internet outage during the two months
I’ve been with fiber7 now.
</p>

<p>
Also, while I am not continuously monitoring my bandwidth, rest assured that
whenever I download something, I am able to utilize the full Gigabit, meaning I
get an aggregate speed of 118 MB/s from servers that support it. Such servers
are for example one-click hosters like uploaded, but also Debian mirrors (as
soon as you download from multiple ones in parallel).
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
tl;dr: fiber7 delivers. Incredible latency, no outages (yet), full download speed.

    <link href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2014-08-11-fiber7_ubnt_erlite/"/>
    <id>https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2014-08-11-fiber7_ubnt_erlite/</id>
    <published>2014-08-11T09:55:00+00:00</published>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
I immediately ordered a <a href="http://www.fiber7.ch/">fiber7</a> internet
connection once it became available, and I’ve been connected since a few weeks.
They offer a 1 Gbps symmetrical fiber connection, with native (static) IPv6 and
no traffic limit — for 65 CHF per month (about 54 €).
</p>

<p>
In the order form, they let you choose whether you want to order a
pre-configured MikroTik RB2011UiAS-2HnD including fiber optic and fiber patch
cable. I assumed this would be an excellent choice, so I ordered it.
</p>

<p>
I really like the MikroTik device. Its CLI and web interface are well
thought-out and easy to use once you understand their way of thinking. It’s
small, absolutely silent and just works. However, there’s one shortcoming: it
doesn’t do IPv4 hardware acceleration (they call it “fast path”) when you
enable NAT, which you need for a fiber7 connection. Thus, the top bandwidth
maxes out at 500 to 600 Mbps, so effectively you only use half of your
available bandwidth.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, I looked around for other routers which can do a full Gigabit
WAN-to-LAN, i.e. with IPv4-NAT enabled. The selection of routers that can do
that is very small, see for example <a
href="http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/lanwan/router-charts/view">the
smallnetbuilder WAN-to-LAN router charts</a>.
</p>

<p>
In my first try, I went with the Netgear R7000 (“Nighthawk”) which is the
highest-performing router with regards to WAN-to-LAN bandwidth on
smallnetbuilder. It indeed does hardware acceleration for IPv4-NAT, so you
<strong>can</strong> reach the full 118 MB/s TCP bandwidth that a Gigabit line
offers. However, the firmware does not do DHCPv6-PD (Prefix Delegation), even
though it’s certified as IPv6-ready. There are alternative firmwares, e.g.
Tomato and DD-WRT. Tomato (v121 as of writing) comes with the kernel module
that enables IPv4-NAT hardware acceleration, but has a nasty bug: the latency
jumps up to 500ms for most of your packets, which is clearly not acceptable.
DD-WRT does not come with such a kernel module because they use a newer kernel,
so the speed maxes out at 400 Mbps (that’s what they claim, I didn’t even
bother testing it).
</p>

<h2>Ubiquiti EdgeRouter Lite (Erlite-3)</h2>

<p>
So, as a second try, I ordered what everyone recommended me in the first place:
the <a href="http://www.ubnt.com/edgemax/edgerouter-lite/">Ubiquiti EdgeRouter
Lite (Erlite-3)</a>.
</p>

<p>
The EdgeRouter Lite (tested with firmware v1.5.0 and v1.6.0) offers IPv4 and
IPv6 offloading, and in fact reaches Gigabit line rate (118 MB/s measured TCP
performance). An unwelcome surprise is that hardware acceleration only works
when <strong>not</strong> using bridging at all, so if you want to connect two
devices to your router in the same subnet, like a computer and a switch, you
cannot do that. Effectively, the EdgeRouter needs to sit between the internet
connection and a switch.
</p>

<p>
With regards to the web interface of EdgeOS: the web interface feels very
polished and modern, but it seems to lack a number of features that are only
accessible in the CLI interface. The MikroTik web interface had a much higher
coverage of features. In general, I like how Ubiquiti does many things right,
though: firmware updates are quick and painless, the model selection and
download on their website is very simple to find and use, and you even get a
link to the relevant GPL tarball without asking :).
</p>

<h2>Properly disconnecting your old router</h2>

<p>
First of all, you should disconnect the MikroTik (or your current router) from
the network. I recommend doing that by explicitly disabling both DHCP clients,
so that the fiber7 router knows you are not using the old device any more. This
is important because fiber7 uses a Cisco feature called “IP source guard”,
which will disable any MAC address on your port that does not have a DHCP
lease. Therefore, if you just switch routers, you need to wait for the old
lease to expire before you get a new lease. In my first tests, this worked
relatively well, but then a lease got stuck for some reason and I had to
escalate the problem to their NOC. So, better disable the DHCP:
</p>
<pre>
/ip dhcp-client set disabled=yes numbers=0
/ipv6 dhcp-client set disabled=yes numbers=0
</pre>

<h2>Configuring the EdgeRouter Lite for fiber7</h2>

<p>
In my configuration, I connect a switch to eth0 and a media converter (the
TP-LINK MC220L) to eth1. Pay attention to configure the media converter to
“auto”, not “force”. In both cases you’ll get a link, but with “force”, you
will not get any replies to your packets.
</p>

<p>
A general tip: if you mess up your IP configuration, you can always use the
link-local address of the EdgeRouter and SSH into that. Find the link-local
address using <code>ping6 ff02::1%eth0</code>.
</p>

<p>
After logging into the web interface, set the eth1 address to DHCP and it
should get a public IPv4 address from fiber7. Afterwards, enable NAT by
clicking on NAT → Add Source NAT Rule. Set the outbound interface to eth1 and
select the “masquerade” radio button. You’ll also need to switch to the
“services” tab and enable a DHCP and DNS server. This should give you IPv4
connectivity to the internet.
</p>

<p>
Now on to IPv6. Since EdgeOS version 1.6.0, DHCPv6-PD is an easily usable
feature. Log into the router using <code>ssh ubnt@192.168.1.1</code>, then run
the following commands:
</p>

<pre>
configure
set interfaces ethernet eth1 dhcpv6-pd pd 0 prefix-length /48
set interfaces ethernet eth1 dhcpv6-pd pd 0 interface eth0 service slaac
set interfaces ethernet eth1 dhcpv6-pd pd 0 interface eth0 prefix-id :0
commit
save
exit
reboot
</pre>

<p>
The <code>prefix-length</code> specifies how big the prefix is that the ISP is
giving us; a <code>/48</code> in the case of fiber7. The next lines specify
that we want to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLAAC">SLAAC</a> to
hand out addresses of the delegated prefix on <code>eth0</code>. The
<code>prefix-id</code> is used for the part after the /48, so if you set it to
e.g. <code>ff23</code>, and your prefix is <code>2a02:168:4a09::/48</code>, the
EdgeRouter will announce <code>2a02:168:4a09:ff23::/64</code> on
<code>eth0</code>.
</p>

<p>
For me, the reboot was necessary after changing settings, so try rebooting if
things don’t work as they should.
</p>

<p>
When running <code>ip -6 address show dev eth0</code> you should see that
the router added an IPv6 address like
<code>2a02:168:4a09:0:de9f:dbff:fe81:a905/64</code> to eth0.
</p>

<p>
That’s it! On clients you should be able to <code>ping6 google.ch</code> now
and get replies.
</p>

<h2>Bonus: Configuring a DHCPv6-DUID</h2>

<p>
fiber7 wants to hand out static IPv6 prefixes based on the DHCPv6 option 37,
but that’s not ready yet. Until then, they offer you to set a static prefix
based on your DUID (a device identifier based on the MAC address of your
router). Since I switched from the MikroTik, I needed to port its DUID to the
EdgeRouter to keep my static prefix.
</p>

<p>
Luckily, wide-dhcpv6 reads a file called dhcp6c_duid that you can create with
the proper DUID. The file starts with a 16-bit integer containing the length of
the DUID, followed by the raw DUID:
</p>

<pre>
echo -en '\x00\x0a\x00\x03\x00\x01\x4c\x5e\x0c\x43\xbf\x39' > /var/lib/dhcpv6/dhcp6c_duid
</pre>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
I can see why fiber7 went with the MikroTik as their offer for customers: it
combines a media converter (for fiber to ethernet), a router, a switch and a
wifi router. In my configuration, those are now all separate devices: the
TP-LINK MC220L (27 CHF), the Ubiquiti EdgeRouter Lite Erlite-3 (170 CHF) and
the TP-LINK WDR4300 (57 CHF). The ping latency to google.ch has gone up from
0.6ms to 0.7ms due to the additional device, but the download rate is about
twice as high, so I think this is the setup that I’ll keep for a while — until
somebody comes up with an all-in-one device that provides the same features and
achieves the same rates :-).
</p>

<h2>Appendix: IPv6 with EdgeOS &lt; 1.7.0</h2>

<p>
For EdgeOS 1.6.0, you’ll need to add router advertisement settings:
</p>
<pre>
configure
set interfaces ethernet eth1 dhcpv6-pd pd 0 prefix-length /48
set interfaces ethernet eth1 dhcpv6-pd pd 0 interface eth0 service slaac
set interfaces ethernet eth1 dhcpv6-pd pd 0 interface eth0 prefix-id :0
set interfaces ethernet eth0 ipv6 router-advert prefix ::/64
set interfaces ethernet eth0 ipv6 router-advert radvd-options
  "RDNSS 2001:4860:4860::8888 {};"
commit
save
exit
reboot
</pre>

<h2>Appendix: IPv6 with EdgeOS &lt; 1.6.0</h2>

<p>
IPv6 is a bit harder, since EdgeOS in its current version (1.5.0) does not
support DHCPv6-PD via its Web or CLI interface. The necessary software
(wide-dhcpv6) is included, though, so we can configure it manually.
</p>

<p>
For the next steps, you need to know the transfer network IP range, which seems
to be different for every fiber7 POP (location). You can get it by either using
DHCPv6 and looking at the address you get, by checking your MikroTik
configuration (if you have one) or by asking fiber7. In my case, the range is
<code>2a02:168:2000:5::/64</code>, but I’ve heard from others that they have
<code>2a02:168:2000:9::/64</code>.
</p>

<p>
Use <code>ssh ubnt@192.168.1.1</code> to log into the CLI. In order to set the
proper IPv6 address on the transfer network, run <code>ip -6 address show dev
eth1</code> and look for a line that says <code>inet6
fe80::de9f:dbff:fe81:a906/64 scope link</code>. Copy everything after the
<code>::</code> and prefix it with <code>2a02:168:2000:5:</code> (your fiber7
transfer network range), then configure that as static IPv6 address on eth1 and
set the default route (and enable IPv6 offloading):
</p>
<pre>
configure
set system offload ipv6 forwarding enable
set interfaces ethernet eth1 address 2a02:168:2000:5:de9f:dbff:fe81:a906/64
set protocols static route6 ::/0 next-hop 2a02:168:2000:5::1 interface eth1
commit
save
exit
</pre>

<p>
Now you should be able to run <code>ping6 google.ch</code> and get a reply.
We still need to enable DHCPv6 though so that the router gets a prefix and
hands that out to its clients. Run <code>sudo -s</code> to get a root shell and
configure DHCPv6:
</p>
<pre>
cat >/etc/wide-dhcpv6/dhcp6c-script-zkj <<'EOT'
#!/bin/sh
# wide-dhcpv6-client 20080615-12 does not properly close
# file descriptors when starting the script.
# https://bugs.debian.org/757848
exec 4>&- 5>&- 6>&- 7>&-
# To prevent radvd from sending the final router advertisment
# that unconfigures the prefixes.
killall -KILL radvd
/etc/init.d/radvd restart
exit 0
EOT
chmod +x /etc/wide-dhcpv6/dhcp6c-script-zkj

cat >/etc/wide-dhcpv6/dhcp6c.conf <<'EOT'
interface eth1 {
        send ia-pd 0;
        request domain-name-servers;
        script "/etc/wide-dhcpv6/dhcp6c-script-zkj";
};

id-assoc pd 0 {
        prefix-interface eth0 {
                sla-id 1;
                sla-len 0;
        };
};
EOT

sed -i 's/eth0/eth1/g' /etc/default/wide-dhcpv6-client

cat >/config/scripts/post-config.d/dhcpv6.sh <<'EOT'
#!/bin/sh
/etc/init.d/wide-dhcpv6-client start
EOT
chmod +x /config/scripts/post-config.d/dhcpv6.sh

/config/scripts/post-config.d/dhcpv6.sh
</pre>

<p>
Now, when running <code>ip -6 address show dev eth0</code> you should see that
the router added an IPv6 address like
<code>2a02:168:4a09:0:de9f:dbff:fe81:a905/48</code> to eth0. Let’s enable
router advertisments so that clients get an IPv6 address, route and DNS server:
</p>
<pre>
configure
set interfaces ethernet eth0 ipv6 router-advert prefix ::/64
set interfaces ethernet eth0 ipv6 router-advert radvd-options
  "RDNSS 2001:4860:4860::8888 {};"
commit
save
exit
</pre>

<p>
That’s it! On clients you should be able to <code>ping6 google.ch</code> now and get replies.
