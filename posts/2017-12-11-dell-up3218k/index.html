  <h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>Ever since I first used a MacBook Pro with Retina display back in 2013, I’ve
been madly in love with hi-DPI displays. I had seen the device before, and
marvelled at brilliant font quality with which scientific papers would be
rendered. But it wasn’t until I had a chance to use the device for a few hours
to make i3 compatible with hi-DPI displays that I realized what a difference it
makes in the day-to-day life.</p>
<p>Note that when I say “hi-DPI display”, I mean displays with an integer multiple
of 96 dpi, for example displays with 192 dpi or 288 dpi. I explain this because
some people use the same term to mean “anything more than 96 dpi”.</p>
<p>In other words, some people are looking for many pixels (e.g. running a 32 inch
display with 3840x2160 pixels, i.e. 137 dpi, with 100% scaling), whereas I
desire crisp/sharp text (i.e. 200% scaling).</p>
<p>Hence, in 2014, I bought the Dell UP2414Q with 3840x2160 on 24&quot; (185 dpi), which
was one of the first non-Apple devices to offer a dpi that Apple would market as
“Retina”.</p>
<p>After getting the Dell UP2414Q, I replaced all displays in my life with hi-DPI
displays one by one. I upgraded my phone, my personal laptop, my work laptop and
my monitor at work.</p>
<h3 id="dell-up3218k">Dell UP3218K</h3>
<p>In January 2017, Dell introduced the Dell Ultrasharp UP3218K monitor at the
Consumer Electronics Show (CES). It is the world’s first available 8K monitor,
meaning it has a resolution of 7680x4320 pixels at a refresh rate of 60 Hz. The
display’s dimensions are 698.1mm by 392.7mm (80cm diagonal, or 31.5 inches),
meaning the display shows 280 dpi.</p>
<p>While the display was available in the US for quite some time, it took until
October 2017 until it became available in Switzerland.</p>
<h3 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h3>
<p>The UP3218K requires connecting two separate DisplayPort 1.4 cables in order to
reach the native resolution and refresh rate. When connecting only one cable,
you will be limited to a refresh rate of 30 Hz, which is a very noticeable
annoyance on any display: you can literally see your mouse cursor lag
behind. Ugh.</p>
<p>Note that this mode of connection does not use Multi-Stream Transport (MST),
which was a trick that first-generation 4K displays used. Instead, it uses the
regular Single-Stream Transport (SST), but two cables.</p>
<p>As of November 2017, only latest-generation graphics cards support DisplayPort
1.4 at all, with e.g. the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/products/10series/geforce-gtx-1060/">nVidia GTX
1060</a>
being marketed as “DisplayPort 1.2 Certified, DisplayPort 1.3/1.4 Ready”.</p>
<h4 id="amd-radeon-pro-wx7100">AMD Radeon Pro WX7100</h4>
<p>Hence, I thought I would play it safe and buy a graphics card which is
explicitly described as compatible with the UP3218K: I ordered an AMD Radeon Pro
WX7100.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have to report that the WX7100 is only able to drive the
monitor at native resolution when using Windows. On Linux, I was limited to
1920x1080 at 60Hz (!) when using the Open Source amdgpu driver. With the Closed
Source amdgpu-pro driver, I reached 3840x2160 at 60Hz, which is still not the
native resolution. Also, the amdgpu-pro driver is a hassle to install: it
requires an older kernel and isn’t packaged well in Debian.</p>
<h4 id="nvidia-geforce-gtx-1060">nVidia GeForce GTX 1060</h4>
<p>I returned the WX7100 in exchange for the cheapest and most quiet GeForce 10
series card with 2 DisplayPort outputs I could find. My choice was the <a href="https://www.msi.com/Graphics-card/GeForce-GTX-1060-GAMING-X-6G.html">MSI
GeForce GTX 1060 GAMING X 6G (MSI
V328-001R)</a>. The
card seems like overkill, given that I don’t intend to play games on this
machine, but lower-end cards all come with at most one DisplayPort output.</p>
<p>Regardless, I am happy with the card. It indeed is silent, and with the Closed
Source driver, it powers the UP3218K without any trouble. Notably, it supports
RandR 1.5, which I’ll talk about a bit more later.</p>

<h4 id="recommendation">Recommendation</h4>
<p>If you want to play it safe, buy an nVidia card of the GeForce 10 series. Verify
that it says “DisplayPort 1.4 Ready”, and that it comes with two DisplayPort
outputs.</p>
<p>I read about <a href="https://heise.de/-3900646">improvements of the amdgpu driver for the upcoming Linux
4.15</a>, but I don’t know whether that will help with
the problems at hand.</p>
<h3 id="impressions">Impressions</h3>
<p>The unboxing experience is well-designed, and all components make a good
impression. All cables which you will need (two DisplayPort cables, a power
cable, a USB cable) are included and seem to be of high quality.</p>
<p>The display has a thin bezel, much thinner than my other monitors ViewSonic
VX2475Smhl-4K or Dell UP2414Q.</p>
<p>The power LED is white and not too bright. The on-screen menu reacts quickly and
is reasonably intuitive.</p>
<p>The built-in USB hub works flawlessy, even with devices which don’t work on my
standalone USB3 hub (for reasons which I have yet to find out).</p>
<h4 id="display-quality">Display Quality</h4>
<p>The display quality of the screen is stunningly good.</p>
<p>It was only when I configured 300% scaling that I realized why some Chromebooks
had a distinctly different look and feel from other computers I had used: I
always assumed they differed in font rendering somehow, but the actual
difference is just the screen DPI: fonts look distinctly better with 288 dpi
than with 192 dpi, which of course looks better than 96 dpi.</p>
<p>Some people might wonder whether an 8K display is any better than a 4K display,
and I now can answer that question with a decisive “yes, one can easily see the
difference”. I’m not sure if the difference between a 288 dpi and a 384 dpi
display would be visible, but we’ll see when we get there :-).</p>
<h4 id="glossy">Glossy</h4>
<p>What I didn’t expect is that the UP3218K is a glossy display, as opposed to a
matte display. Depending on the brightness and colors, you might see
reflections. With my preferred brightness of 50%, I can clearly see reflections
when displaying darker colors, e.g. on a black terminal emulator background, or
even in my grey Emacs theme.</p>
<p>While one can mentally ignore the reflections after a little while, I still
consider the glossyness a mild annoyance. I hope as 8K displays become more
prevalent, display vendors will offer matte 8K displays as well.</p>
<h4 id="scaling">Scaling</h4>
<p>I found it interesting that the display works well in both 200% scaling and 300%
scaling.</p>
<p>When running the display at 200% scaling, you get 3840x2160 (4K resolution)
“logical pixels”, but sharper.</p>
<p>When running the display at 300% scaling, you get 2560x1440 “logical pixels”,
but extremely sharp.</p>
<p>I would say it is a subjective preference which of the two settings to use. Most
likely, people who prefer many pixels would run the display at 200%, whereas I
prefer the 300% scaling mode for the time being.</p>
<h3 id="linux-compatibility--configuration">Linux compatibility / configuration</h3>
<p>To use this display without gross hacks, ensure all relevant components in your
software stack support RandR 1.5. My known working configuration is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Xorg 1.19.5</li>
<li>nVidia driver 375.82</li>
<li>libxcb 1.12</li>
<li>i3 4.14</li>
<li>i3lock 2.10</li>
</ul>
<p>With the following command, you can create a RandR MONITOR object spanning the
DisplayPort outputs DP-4 and DP-2:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>xrandr --setmonitor up3218k auto DP-4,DP-2
</code></pre><p>I place this command in my <code>~/.xsession</code> before starting <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a>.</p>
<p>Theoretically, Xorg could create a MONITOR object automatically. I filed <a href="https://bugzilla.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=103794">a
feature request</a> for
this.</p>
<h3 id="scaling-compatibility">Scaling compatibility</h3>
<p>With regards to scaling issues, the situation is very similar to any other
monitor which requires scaling. Applications which were updated to support 200%
scaling seem to work with 300% scaling just as well.</p>
<p>Of course, applications which were not yet updated to work with scaling look
even smaller than on 200% displays, so it becomes more of a nuisance to use
them. As far as I can tell, the most likely offender are Java applications such
as JDownloader.</p>
<h3 id="buzzing-noise">Buzzing noise</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, the monitor emits a high-pitched buzzing noise, very similar to
Coil Whine. The noise is loud enough to prevent focused work without listening
to music.</p>
<p>I verified that this symptom was happening with Windows and Linux, on two
different computers, with default monitor settings, and even when no input
source was connected at all.</p>
<p>Finally, I contacted Dell support about it. In the call I received on the next
business day, they were very forthcoming and offered to replace the monitor.</p>
<p>The replacement monitor still emits some noise, but much less pronounced. I
think I can easily ignore the noise.</p>
<p><strong>Update after 2+ years</strong>: I had honestly forgotten that the replacement monitor
also made noise. Maybe it went away, or my ears have gotten worse, or I just
didn’t notice for long enough.</p>
<h3 id="wakeup-issues">Wakeup issues</h3>
<p>Rarely (less than once a week), when waking up the monitor from DPMS standby
mode, only the left half of the screen would appear on my monitor.</p>
<p>This can be fixed by turning the monitor off and on again.</p>
<p>My theory is that one of the scalers does not manage to synchronize with the
video card, but I don’t know for sure.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, I also encountered this issue with the Dell UP2414Q I
bought in 2014. My workaround is to power down that display using its power
button in the evenings, and power it up in the mornings.</p>
<p><strong>Update after 2+ years</strong>: I have now figured out that the monitor wakes up
reliably after:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Swapping the cables around at my Graphics Card, i.e. using output <code>DP-4</code> for
the left monitor half and output <code>DP-0</code> for the right monitor half, not the
other way around:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>xrandr \
--output DP-4 --mode 3840x4320 --panning 0x0+0+0 \
--output DP-0 --mode 3840x4320 --panning 0x0+3840+0 --right-of DP-4
</code></pre></li>
<li>
<p>When powering on the monitor, waiting until it shows the dialog box “No
signal on DP1”, and only then waking up my machine to generate a signal.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When disconnecting and re-connecting the monitor to another machine,
I found these steps the most reliable:</p>
<ol>
<li>Power off the monitor, then unplug the two DisplayPort cables.</li>
<li>Plug in both cables, then power the monitor on again.
<br>
An easy mistake to make is to not push the DisplayPort connector in all the
way. This issue usually manifests itself as the monitor still showing a picture
(because the second cable likely is plugged in correctly), but the full
resolution not being available.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have used these two steps twice a workday for weeks on end, and the monitor
came up reliably every single time.</p>
<h3 id="power-usage">Power Usage</h3>
<p>When the display is turned on, it consumes about 70W of power.</p>
<p>But, when the display enters “power saving mode”, for example because you ran
<code>xset dpms force off</code>, it still consumes 30W of power! Therefore, better turn it
off with the button every night, so that it consumes less than 1W.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>For me, this monitor is worth it: I am okay with paying the hefty Research &amp;
Development tax that first-to-market products such as this monitor have. I like
to think that I’m voting with my wallet to make sure vendors notice my interest
in “Retina” displays.</p>
<p>For most people, I would recommend to wait until the second or third generation
of 8K monitors. By then, I expect most issues to be resolved, compatibility to
not be a concern, and vendors focusing on extra features. Hopefully, we’ll
eventually see matte 8K monitors with higher refresh rates than 60 Hz.</p>
