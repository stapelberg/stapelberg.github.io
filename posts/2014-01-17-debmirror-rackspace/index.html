As explained in more detail in my <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~stapelberg/2013/12/25/codesearch-rackspace.html">my
last blog post</a>, Rackspace is providing hosting for <a
href="http://codesearch.debian.net/">Debian Code Search</a>. For those of you
who don’t know, Rackspace is a cloud company that provides (among other
services) a public cloud based on <a
href="http://www.openstack.org/">OpenStack</a>. That means you can easily (and
programmatically, if you want) bring up virtual servers, block storage volumes,
configure the network between them, etc.
</p>

<p>
As part of my initial performance experiments, I was running <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/sid/debmirror">debmirror</a> to clone a full
Debian source mirror, and I noticed this took about one hour. Given that the
peak network and storage write rates I have observed in my benchmarks are much
higher, I wondered why it took so long. About 43 GB (that’s how big the Debian
sid sources are) in 60 minutes means ≈&nbsp;12&nbsp;MB/s download rate, which
is a bit more than a sustained 100&nbsp;MBit/s connection. Luckily, at least
the Rackspace servers I looked at are connected with 1&nbsp;GBit/s to the
internet, so more should be possible. Note that these are the old Rackspace
servers. There is a new generation of servers, which I have not yet tried, that
apparently offer even higher performance.
</p>

<p>
After a brief look at the debmirror source code, I concluded that it can only
use a single mirror and downloads files sequentially. There is some obvious
potential for improvement here, and the fact that I could come up with a proof
of concept written in <a href="http://www.golang.org/">Go</a> to determine the
files to download in a couple of minutes encouraged me to spend my saturday on
this “problem” :-).
</p>

<p>
About 7 hours later, my prototype had gone through various iterations and the
code could sustain about 115&nbsp;MB/s incoming bandwidth for most of the time.
Here is a screenshot of <a href="http://dag.wiee.rs/home-made/dstat/">dstat</a>
measuring the performance:
</p>

<img src="../../Bilder/screenshots/2013-10-12-213243_1151x1131_scrot.png">

<p>
Another 3 hours later, the most obvious bugs were weeded out and the code
successfully cloned an entire mirror for the first time. I verified the
correctness by running debmirror afterwards, and no files were downloaded that
had not actually arrived on the mirror in the meantime.
</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Parallel downloading from multiple mirrors.</strong><br>
Of course, it is not guaranteed that the mirrors are consistent, but that is a
solvable problem: whenever a non-200 HTTP response is encountered, the file is
put back into the queue and gets rescheduled onto any mirror. Eventually, it
will be rescheduled onto the mirror from which the sources.gz was downloaded,
and that mirror has to have it.
</li>

<li>
<strong>HTTP keep-alive and pipelining.</strong><br>
debmirror also does HTTP keep-alive (I read that in the source, did not verify
it), but it downloads files sequentially, i.e. it downloads one file, then
sends the request for the next file. This means that after one file was
received, no data is being received until another round-trip finished. For a
lot of small files (think of .dsc and .debian.tar.gz files or small orig
tarballs) that really adds up.<br>
Therefore, I use HTTP pipelining: I send 99 requests and then just receive all
the responses at full speed. The magic number 99 comes from the fact that this
is the smallest common denominator that all mirrors I have tested allow. nginx
by default allows 100 requests.
</li>

<li>
<strong>Request ordering.</strong><br>
Instead of sending requests at random, I sort the download queue by size and
make sure that the first request on each connection is for a big file. The
intention is that TCP will adapt to that quickly and use a bigger window size
as soon as possible instead of ramping up slower later on. Note that I have not
actually measured the window sizes, so this is just a hunch.<br>
Another nice side-effect of the ordering is that the amount of data that is
being sent through each connection is roughly equal. This means we don’t waste
TCP connections by sending 99 requests for small files only.
</li>

<li>
<strong>(Goroutines).</strong><br>
I’m a bit hesitant to even write about it, so let’s make it quick: Perl (and
thus debmirror) is typically single-threaded, whereas Goroutines scale nicely
on multi-core systems. I don’t think it makes a big difference on the machines
I am running this on as they have only two cores and are not maxed out on CPU
usage at all. But maybe this will be more important for saturating 10 GBit/s?
:-)
</li>

<li>
<strong>(Mirror selection).</strong><br>
It’s not a feature of the code, but certainly relevant: of course I selected
mirrors that are connected to the internet with at least a Gigabit link, serve
files reasonably fast and have low latency to Rackspace’s Chicago presence.<br>
Interestingly, while I used to think that universities have access to big
uplinks and beefy machines, none of the mirrors that I use are located at a
university. In fact, every mirror ending in <code>.edu</code> that I tried was
really slow — most of them providing something like 2-4 MB/s.
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>
With the latest iteration of the code, I can clone an entire Debian source
mirror with ≈ 43 GB of data in about 11.5 minutes, which corresponds to a
≈&nbsp;63&nbsp;MB/s download rate:
</p>

<pre>
GOMAXPROCS=20 ./dcs-debmirror -num_workers=20
68,24s user 384,90s system 66% cpu 11:25,97 total
</pre>

<p>
It should be noted that the download rate is
very low in the first couple of seconds since the sources.gz file is downloaded
from a single mirror, then unpacked and analyzed.
</p>

<p>
The peak download rate is about 115 MB/s (= 920 MBit/s) which is reasonably
close at what you can achieve with a Gigabit link, I think. If the entire
uplink was available to me at all time, the Rackspace hardware would be able to
saturate that easily, both in terms of reading from the network and in terms of
writing to block storage. I tested this on an SSD volume, but I see about 113
MB/s throughput with the internal hard disk, so I think that should work, too.
</p>

<p>
There is <a href="../../Bilder/screenshots/2013-10-12-213844_1151x1131_scrot.png">another
dstat screenshot of the final version (writing to disk)</a>.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps even more interesting to some readers is the time for an incremental
update:
</p>

<pre>
GOMAXPROCS=20 ./dcs-debmirror -tcp_conns=20
2013/10/13 11:09:55 Downloading 307 files (447 MB total)
…
2013/10/13 11:10:04 All 307 files downloaded in 9.105605931s. Download rate is 49.186567 MB/s
4,91s user 3,99s system 67% cpu 13,205 total
</pre>

<p>
The wall clock time is higher than the time reported by the code because the
code does not count the time for downloading and parsing the sources.gz file.
</p>

<p>
The entire program is about 400 lines (not SLOC) of Go code. It’s part of <a
href="https://github.com/Debian/dcs">the Debian Code Search source</a>. If
you’re interested, you can <a
href="https://github.com/Debian/dcs/blob/master/cmd/dcs-debmirror/dcs-debmirror.go">read
dcs-debmirror.go in your browser</a>.
</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>
The outcome of this experiment is that I now know (and have shown!) that there
are significantly more efficient ways of cloning a Debian mirror than what
debmirror does. Furthermore, I have a good grasp on what kind of performance
the Rackspace cloud offers and I am fairly happy with the numbers :-).
</p>

<p>
My code is useful to me in context of Debian Code Search, but unless you need a
sid-only source-only mirror, it will not be useful to you directly. Of course
you can take the ideas that I implemented and implement them elsewhere —
personally, I don’t plan to do that.
</p>

<p>
If you have hardware, bandwidth and a use-case for 10 GBit/s+ mirroring, I’d
like to hear about it! :-)
